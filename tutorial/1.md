# Setup + Window

## Project Setup

In order to start, we need a proper project setup. This means installing [python](http://python.org) before we begin.

Create a folder where you would like the project to live and cd (change directory) into it. 

```bash
mkdir sidescrolling-platformer
cd sidescrolling-platformer
```

Create a folder for the source files to live in:

```bash
mkdir platformer
```

Create an entry point file:

```bash
code main.py
```

Create a virtual environment at the root of the project:

```bash
python -m .venv venv
```

A new folder named `.venv/` should have been created at the root. This will house all of our dependencies.

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
./venv/Scripts/activate
```

Install our dependencies:

```bash
py -m pip install pygame-ce
```

This will install PyGame-CE locally.

## Coding Time!

First, lets create a `/core` folder inside `/platformer`. Here, we will create our `game.py` file, which will house the main application that manages the window and game loop.

Please see [the code](../platformer/core/game.py) to see the implementation.

Now, lets actually run it! First, create an `__init__.py` file inside of `/platformer/core/` to simplify imports.

See [the code](../platformer/core/__init__.py) for the implementation.

Now we are finally ready to write the entry point. Go to `main.py` at the root of the project. Since we structured our code properly from the get-go, we can easily import our `Game` class:

```python
from platformer.core import Game
```

Finally, construct a Game instance and run it!

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
	Game().run()
```
