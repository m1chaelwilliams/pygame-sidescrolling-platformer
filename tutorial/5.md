# Delta Time

We want our game to run at the same speed no matter what device is being used to play it. If the player can run 10 tiles/second on a fast computer, it should be the exact same on a slow one. The solution is, as titled, delta time.

## Coding Time!

First, we need to get delta time in terms of seconds. This is really easy to do in PyGame. Go to [game.py](../platformer/core/game.py) and edit the `clock.tick` line to this:

```python
dt = self.clock.tick(120) / 1000
```

The argument in `.tick` is the target frame rate of the app. If left blank, the game will simply run as fast as possible. If you want a different target, feel free to change the number. Although I will warn you that all calculations I made in the physics section use this target FPS. It won't break, but will be a bit janky.

Now we have to send this `dt` to the rest of the app. Add an argument to `update` to receive `dt`. Also, add an argument to `Entity`'s update method to receive `dt` as well. Now, every time we move something, we want to multiply it by `dt`.

### "Things Aren't Moving!"

Print out `dt`. It's really, really small. On my machine, it's 0.008-0.009. This means our translations of 5 are now only 0.4. Since PyGame uses integers, this is completely rounded off. We need to use much larger coordinates from now on.
