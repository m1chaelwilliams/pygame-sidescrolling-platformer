# Camera

## Background

First thing to get straight: camera's aren't real (in video games at least). A camera is just adding an offset to the tile's positions for drawing that give the illusion of a changing perspective.

## Coding Time!

### Camera Class

Let's make a new file called `camera.py` inside `platformer/core`. This will have a field `offset` of type `Vec2` and a `follow` method.

Here is the implementation:
```python
from pygame import Rect
from ..utils import Vec2

class Camera:
    def __init__(self, init_pos: Vec2) -> None:
        self.offset = init_pos
    def follow(self, target: Rect, screen_size: Vec2) -> None:
        self.offset = Vec2(
            -target.x + (screen_size.x / 2 - target.width / 2),
            -target.y + (screen_size.y / 2 - target.height / 2),
        )

    # convenience methods since we'll be applying the offset frequently
    def add_offset_coord(self, coord: Vec2) -> Vec2:
        return self.offset + coord
    def add_offset_rect(self, rect: Rect) -> Rect:
        return Rect(
            rect.x + self.offset.x,
            rect.y + self.offset.y,
            rect.width,
            rect.height
        )
```

### Using the Camera

Back to [game.py](../platformer/core/game.py), we need to import camera and add it to our list of fields. We also need something temporary that represents our player.

We should add functionality to move the player, so we can actually see the camera in action:

```python
held = pygame.key.get_pressed()
if held[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
	self.player_rect.x += 5
if held[pygame.K_LEFT]:
	self.player_rect.x -= 5
if held[pygame.K_UP]:
	self.player_rect.y -= 5
if held[pygame.K_DOWN]:
	self.player_rect.y += 5
```

Inside the `update` method, we must call the camera's `follow` method, to ensure that it is always up to date with the player's current position. If you wish to only call this when the player's position has changed, that's a good optimization, but won't really change performance too much for the time being.

Finally, in the `draw` method, we must add the `camera.offset` to every single draw call we make.
