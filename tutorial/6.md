# Physics

Time to implement a robust, feature rich, super efficient physics engine in one video! No?

Physics engines are complex. To implement one in a single video, let alone an intermediate python series, would be too much.

## Alternative to a Physics Engine

What do we actually *need* in a platformer? Well, our platformer is tile-based. So, we only need generic AABB collisions, and a way to apply velocity and acceleration to mobile entities. This is much simpler than a whole engine, and will satisfy what we need.
