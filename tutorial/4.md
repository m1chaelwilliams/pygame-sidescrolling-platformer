# Player

It's time to get rid of that temporary rect representing our player. Let's create a new folder in `platformer/` called `sprites/`. Inside that folder create a new file called `entity.py` that will house our default entity and our Player. *Note: We might move player to its own class if the class becomes too large.* 

Here are our imports:

```python
from pygame import Surface, Rect
from pygame.sprite import Sprite, Group
from pygame.event import Event
import pygame
from ..utils import Vec2
```

We will be using PyGame's built-in `Sprite` and `Group` functionality. We'll begin by writing `Entity`, which will inherit from `pygame.sprite.Sprite`:

```python
class Entity(Sprite):
    def __init__(
            self,
            groups: list[Group],
            image: Surface,
            position: Vec2
        ) -> None:
        super().__init__(groups)
        self.image = image
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(topleft = position.as_tupi())

    def update(self, events: list[Event], held: dict) -> None:
        pass

    def draw(self, screen: Surface, offset: Vec2) -> None:
        temp_rect = self.rect.copy()
        temp_rect.x += offset.x
        temp_rect.y += offset.y
        screen.blit(self.image, temp_rect)
```

## Why Make a Generic `Entity` Class?

A task we have as programmers is to follow D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) programming. The `Entity` class serves as a base for all of our Sprites that aren't static tiles. We want to be able to `update` and `draw` every entity, so we provide default implementations. The `Player` then inherits from this class and takes advantage of the already implemented functionality.

```python
class Player(Entity):
    def __init__(
            self,
            groups: list[Group],
            image: Surface,
            position: Vec2
        ) -> None:
        super().__init__(groups, image, position)

    def update(self, events: list[Event], held: dict) -> None:
        if held[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.rect.x += 5
        if held[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.rect.x -= 5
```

Here, we added movement functionality to our player's `update` method. Notice how we didn't have to write a `draw` method? As of right now, there is no additional functionality the player needs for drawing itself. That is going to change soon though... 

Now we need to update our [game.py](../platformer/core/game.py) to use this new player. First, lets add an `__init__.py` inside our `sprites/` folder to make imports easier.

```python
from .entity import Entity, Player
```

Now, replace the old temporary `player_rect` with a new instance of `Player`.

```python
self.player = Player(
	[],
	load_img_scaled("assets/player_static.png", 4),
	Vec2.ZERO
)
```

*`load_img_scaled` is a convenience function I wrote, since we will be scaling lots of images on load.*

```python
def load_img_scaled(path: str, scale: float) -> Surface:
    return pygame.transform.scale_by(
        pygame.image.load(path).convert_alpha(),
        scale
    )
```

Here is the rest of the code where `self.player` is used:

```python
# Inside update

# getting key held events
held = pygame.key.get_pressed()
# updating the player
self.player.update(events, held)
# updating the camera offset
self.camera.follow(self.player.rect, Vec2(*self.screen.get_size()))
```

```python
# Inside draw

self.player.draw(self.screen, self.camera.offset)
```

Now instead of seeing a boring rectangle, an image of our player is shown at the center of our screen!
