I chose computer science because I love creating new things.  Between classes in high school I'd find myself programming a new video game, rather than playing them.  I enjoy the problem solving involved in writing a program, and the immense satisfaction of making something useful.

My educational goal is to maximize the amount of information I can learn to apply it to my future endeavors. I am specifically focusing on flexibility, hoping to harbor new skills that will make me a more dynamic pick for employers. Additionally, I hope to cultivate meaningful relationships with peers and experts in the field while attending university. 

As for my career goals, I want to be someone developing new technology. I have a specific interest in two fields: machine learning and graphics. I would like to work for a cutting edge company like OpenAI as a software engineer.


I was born in the outskirts of Houston Texas in the dawn of the technological age. I lived my entire life in a medium-sized house in a neighborhood with no other kids and no sidewalks for riding my bike. However, I did not mind, because I found myself drifting into my own imagination most days.

Early in my childhood, I was exposed to technology. My entire family is hugely invested in the tech world. My uncles are all either engineers or software engineers. As a result, I was always kept up to date with the latest inventions and discoveries. I remember going to Nasa on a monthly basis, being completely awestruck at the wonders of space. 

I developed the seed planted in my youth while attending high school. I discovered Unity, a game engine rising in popularity at the time. For lark one day, I decided to give it a try. What I did not realize was, I had just completely shifted my destiny. I became obsessed with programming. The time I spent afterschool playing Minecraft or watching YouTube was now spent trying to learn how to code. Over the years, I developed my skills and really made programming a home. My senior year of high school, I even started the first ever computer science club there, spreading the joy I received to new faces.

Upon entering college, I continued to employ my tech-oriented brain through involvement in A.n.I.Ma.L, our A.I. and machine learning club. I also continue to excel in my computer science classes. I love to use coding as my form of self expression, usually through hobby games I work in my spare time.

My life has and remains tightly sewn to the tech world as a core part of who I am.
