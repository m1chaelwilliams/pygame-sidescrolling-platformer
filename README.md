# PyGame Side Scrolling Platformer

The source code and documentation for a tutorial series created by [Coding with Sphere](https://youtube.com/@codingwithsphere)

## Status
- Code: 50%
- Video Series: 0%

This repository contains the source code used as a guide for the PyGame Side scrolling Platformer.

## Documentation

For written documentation, visit: [Documentation](./tutorial/roadmap.md).

*Documentation is limited due to time constraints. It will improve with time. For now, use it as a guide. Much of the learning will have to come from reading actual code, which I believe is the best way to learn anyways.*

## Project Structure
- `main.py` is the entry point of the application.
- `platformer/` contains all of the source files (besides the entry point)
- `tutorial/` contains `.md` files documenting (to the best of my ability) the changes made at each step.
- `data/` contains data related to the game itself.
	- maps
- `assets/` contains assets for the game.

## FAQ

### How does this repository work in relation to the tutorials?
This repository is the "master copy". The tutorials were written *after* completing the project here. The code is mostly correct, allowing for differences in spacing, formatting, function def order (I'm only human ðŸ˜…).

### Why PyGame-CE instead of PyGame?
PyGame-CE is almost the same as PyGame itself, to the point where they could be interchanged and work perfectly fine here. So why the community edition? Well, it's in the name. A majority of veteran PyGame enthusiasts use PyGame-CE due to its rich community. As a result PyGame-CE is better maintained and looks to have a brighter future.

As of right now, there is no license for this project. It only abides by the licenses of its [dependencies](#dependencies).

I do ask that you don't copy my documentation without crediting.
